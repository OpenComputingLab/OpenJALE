# Introduction

OpenJALE, the *Open Jupyter Authoring and Learning Environment*, is an opinionated Jupyter notebook based environment for authoring and wotking with notebook based learning materials.

# Philosophy

An unextended Jupyter notebook or JupyterLab environment provides a minimal interactive environment for creating and working with Jupyter notebooks.

However, by pre-configuring a Jupyter notebook environment with a range of pre-installed and pre-enabled notebook extensions, we can create a much richer environment for authoring and working notebooks.

By authoring learning materials in a way that exploits these extensions, we can create a much more powerful teaching and learning environment.
